# Go-No-Where-TY-Diploma-Project
The application is similar to the urban clap. there are two types of users one who requests the service and one who provides the service, both can register. The requester can request service from the service provider at a specified price, and much more. Wanted to do this as a startup.

This is a PHP based project
To run the php scripts
> 1] First install the XAMPP server\
2] Copy all the files to the "C:\xampp\htdocs\" which is the default directory where the XAMPP server fetches the data.\
3] Now start the xampp server and open this projects index file ('opens by default if folder specified').

Now you might see the UI(user interface)\
But the database is not connected.
> 1] So to connect the database, first go to the phpmyadmin which is provided by the XAMPP server.\
2] Create a database and import the gonowhere.sql file, which is located in the "/import sql" direcrory.\
3] Now edit the file "dbcon.php" which is located in "/pages" directory. (set your details of the myphpadmin and database name)

Now your application is ready to go.\
Yea!
